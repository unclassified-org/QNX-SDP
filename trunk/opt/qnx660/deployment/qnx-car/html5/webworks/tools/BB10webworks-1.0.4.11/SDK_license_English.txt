You shall indemnify, hold harmless, and if requested by RIM, defend, RIM, RIM's affiliates, airtime service providers, agents and their respective successors, assigns, directors, officers, employees and independent contractors (each a "RIM Indemnified Party") from any claims, costs, damages, losses, settlement fees, and expenses (including without limitation attorney fees and disbursements) incurred directly or indirectly by a RIM Indemnified Party as a result of Your or Your Authorized Users' breach of this Agreement and/or as a result of any third party claim, proceeding, suit, judgment, settlement, or cause of action ("Claim"):  (a) alleging the infringement, violation or misappropriation of any intellectual property right including a patent, design, industrial design, copyright, trade secret or trademark or other proprietary  right by: (i) Your Application(s) or the use thereof, or the combination of Your Application(s) with any other hardware, software, system, or service, (ii) any product, service or content made available, or required to be made available, through Your Application, or (iii) Your or Your Authorized Users' combination of the SDK or any portion thereof with any hardware, software, or system or service other than the BlackBerry Solution; (b) alleging libel, slander, or defamation related to the use of Your Applications or any products, service or content made available through Your Application; (c) alleging any injury, death or property or other damage arising from or related to the performance or non-performance of any portion of the SDK or Your Applications or any products, service or content made available through Your Application; (d) based on any representation or misrepresentations made by You or Your Authorized Users or (e) otherwise related to or arising from Your or Your Authorized Users' use of the SDK (except for any third party claim based solely on RIM technology included in the SDK) or any use or distribution of Your Applications (including Your development of Applications), or any portion thereof, or any product, service or content made available, or required to be made available, through Your Application.  Once RIM notifies You of a Claim, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing, all communications (including the notice) shall be deemed confidential information of RIM, which may not be disclosed by You to any third party, other than Your legal advisors, without the prior express written permission of RIM, and in addition, all communications, in respect of any such Claim shall be subject to common interest privilege.  RIM shall provide notice to You of any Claim, and each of You and RIM shall: (A) provide each other all information and assistance reasonably requested by the other in relation to such Claim (provided that You shall reimburse RIM for any out of pocket expenses incurred by a RIM Indemnified Party in doing so); and (B) not admit to any liability or agree to any settlements by or on behalf the other party with respect to such Claims without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  If RIM has requested You to defend a Claim and later has a reasonable basis to believe that You cannot or may not be able to fulfill Your obligations under this Section 16, then, without limiting Your obligations under this Section 16, RIM shall be entitled to provide You with notice of its decision to defend the Claim, and thereafter to assume control of the defense and/or settlement of any such Claim.  Further, if a Claim arises in the context of RIM providing You with access to payment services for Your Application, and a RIM Indemnified Party is required to indemnify any third party (including without limitation a merchant of record, payment processor, or airtime service provider) in respect of a claim, proceeding, suit, judgment, settlement or cause of action relating to Your Applications or any product, service or content made available through Your Applications, then any claim subject to that indemnity shall be deemed to be a Claim against RIM hereunder.  If a Claim hereunder brought against an airtime service provider is also a claim with respect to which RIM or any RIM affiliate is required to indemnify such airtime service provider, then RIM shall in its sole discretion elect to have such claim treated as a Claim against RIM or against the airtime service provider, or each of them under this provision, and shall notify You of same.

If RIME does not provide You with notice of the removal prior to it taking place, RIME shall do so, by means of the Vendor Portal or otherwise, within a commercially reasonable period following the removal.  You further acknowledge that RIME has the right, but has no obligation, to remove an In-App Product from an End User wireless handheld device and/or disable (in whole or in part) the operation of an In-App Product, if the End User's payment for that In-App Product has been refunded by, or charged back to the applicable MoR, or if the End User has engaged in fraud, or as provided in the BlackBerry Commerce Guidelines (including without limitation a breach thereof).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, You further acknowledge and agree that either RIM or RIME may, at any time, in RIM's sole discretion and for any reason whatsoever, remove an In-App Product from an End User's wireless handheld device.

7. Ongoing Availability of In-App Products/Support of In-App Products.  For In-App Products other than those that are sold or licensed on a subscription basis you must continue to make In-App Products available to the End User through the Application with which they were associated on a RIME Store for no less than six (6) months after the date of the download of the copy of the Application through which they are made available and in no event less than the period they are required to be available to the End User by the laws in the jurisdiction of the End User.  For In-App Products that are sold or licensed on a subscription basis you must continue to make In-App Products available to the End User through the Application with which they were associated on a RIME Store for no less than the period for which the End User is entitled based on the subscription and in no event less than the period they are required to be available to the End User by the laws in the jurisdiction of the End User.  You are solely responsible for, and You agree to provide, End Users with support in making In-App Products they have purchased available to them (including providing End Users with a support contact email address), and with reasonable technical and product support to End Users with respect to the In-App Product features, installation and use, which shall include at minimum any warranty for In-App Products consistent with the laws in the jurisdiction of the End User.  

8. Fulfillment/Re-fulfillment Obligations.  In-App Products are not fulfilled (i.e. not hosted, delivered or enabled) through a RIME Store.  Further, neither RIME nor any MoR fulfills any In-App Products, and You are solely responsible for fulfillment of In-App Products, and must satisfy Your fulfillment obligations in respect of each In-App Product.  You therefore will be required to act as the fulfillment agent for the applicable MoR for Your In-App Products.  If You require additional information about these obligations, You should contact appworldvendorsupport@rim.com.  Neither RIME nor any MoR associates In-App Products with Applications in My World or otherwise tracks or displays In-App Products in My World.  Unless otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by RIME, for any In-App Product that is intended to be used as part of or in conjunction with the Application through which it was purchased (e.g. a level of a game or a subscription based In-App Product), You must re-associate (i.e. re-fulfill) the In-App Product with the Application through which it was purchased, upon reinstallation of that Application from My World either: (a) automatically; or (b) upon request by the End User.  In the case of Consumable In-App Products, You are only required to re-associate the portion of In-App Products that have not been consumed at the time of reinstallation.  Neither RIM nor any MoR is responsible for keeping track of consumption of Consumable In-App Products or subscription based In-App Products.  If You require additional information about these obligations, You should contact appworldvendorsupport@rim.com.  

9. Subscription Based In-App Products.  You can offer automatically recurring subscription based In-App Products having only the renewal frequency set out in the applicable documentation.  RIM's BlackBerry Payment Service SDK includes APIs designed to enable You to check the status of an End User's subscription to an In-App Product.  RIME will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify End Users of the intention to charge for the renewal of a subscription based In-App Product prior to renewal and send a receipt to End Users following renewal.  You shall permit End Users to cancel subscriptions to subscription based In-App Products at any time (including without limitation using a RIME Store to do so), and nothing shall preclude RIME, at its sole option, from enabling end users to cancel their subscriptions.

10. License Restrictions.  The Carrier Networks and/or countries You select for an Application's availability will automatically apply to any In-App Products made available through that Application.  You acknowledge and agree that In-App Products may be downloaded by End Users with wireless handhelds operating on Carrier Networks and that Carrier Networks includes not only the wireless networks selected by You, but also wireless networks operated by the roaming partners of those carriers (and further includes any wireless networks in the case of RIM proprietary wireless handhelds that are distributed by RIM without the capability of operating on a wireless cellular network).  Subject to the foregoing, If You do not have the rights necessary to distribute an In-App Product (or any portion thereof) either globally, or at least to End Users with wireless handhelds activated on both the wireless networks You specify in the Vendor Portal for the Application and on the associated roaming wireless networks, and to permit others to do so, or if You are otherwise unable to control the jurisdictions in which End User may download and/or use that In-App Product, then You must not make, or seek to make, that In-App Product available through the BlackBerry Payment Service.

11. Returns of In-App Products.  You acknowledge and agree that the applicable MoR is responsible for and shall have sole discretion in setting and applying the returns policy for instances of In-App Products sold by that MoR (including without limitation subscription based In-App Products).

12. Reporting.  RIME will, from time to time, provide You with aggregated data on sales of In-App Products using the BlackBerry Payment Service.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent RIME from obtaining and publicly disclosing aggregate data relating to the sales of In-App Products using the BlackBerry Payment Service. 

13. Privacy.  The Consent to Collection of Information provisions in this Agreement shall apply equally to End User Data and personally identifiable information made available in the context of the BlackBerry Payment Service.  The enumerated purposes for which such information may be used as set out in the Consent to Collection of Information provision is hereby extended to include any purpose related to the provision or Your use of the BlackBerry Payment Service.  Similarly, the Privacy and Data Protection provision in the RIME Store Vendor Agreement and BlackBerry Commerce Guidelines apply to Your In-App Products and Your use of the BlackBerry Payment SDK.

14. Confidentiality.  There is no need for You to provide to RIME any confidential information in relation to the BlackBerry Payment Service, and You acknowledge and agree that RIME has no confidentiality obligation with respect to any information provided by You to RIME under or in relation to Your In-App Products, the BlackBerry Payment Service or the BlackBerry Payment Service SDK.

15. Independent Development.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, You acknowledge and agree that RIM and its affiliates are also developers and licensees of digital products, services and content that operate on RIM and RIM affiliates' proprietary software platforms, and that RIM and/or its affiliates may currently or in the future develop, use, market, promote, distribute and/or license products and/or services and/or content that are similar to and/or competitive with any In-App Products, and that no provision of this Agreement prohibits or limits in any manner RIM's or its affiliates' ability to do so.

16. BlackBerry Payment Service Availability.  You acknowledge and agree that RIME is under no obligation to continue to make available the BlackBerry Payment Service or to make available any subsequent versions of the BlackBerry Payment Service SDK.  You further acknowledge and agree that RIME may add or remove functionality with respect to the foregoing and may cease to make available the foregoing at any time without any obligation or liability to You.  You shall be solely responsible for any modifications that may be required to Your Applications as a result of any modifications to or subsequent versions of the BlackBerry Payment Service and/or Payment Service SDK (including without limitation the addition or removal of functionality with respect to the foregoing).

17. Distributable Code.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, You may not modify all or any portion of the Payment Service SDK, including without limitation Distributable Code that forms part of the Payment Service SDK.

18. Additional Payment Service SDK License Restrictions 
(a) You shall not use the BlackBerry Payment Service for making available, and shall not provide as part of an In-App Product, software updates, upgrades, or modifications to the associated Application or any executable file formats.  However, You may enable (i.e. unlock) functionality that already exists within an Application through an In-App Product (e.g. unlock a level within a game).  Updates and upgrades for Your Applications are treated as new versions of Your Applications and must be submitted through the RIME Store submission process described in the RIME Store Vendor Agreement and cannot be made available as In-App Products. 
(b) With respect to the BlackBerry Payment Service payment processes You shall only rely on the user interface functionality provided by means of RIM APIs, and shall not use, invoke, or present to any End User, any other user interface functionality.

19. Termination.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, upon termination of this Agreement You shall immediately prevent any further purchases of In-App Products through Applications using the BlackBerry Payment Service. 

20. Conflict.  In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Schedule 2 and the remainder of this Agreement the provisions of this Schedule 2 shall govern to the extent of such conflict.
