# Only the URL prefixes listed here will be allowed to run the specified JNEXT
# extensions. The syntax of this file is as follows:
#  <url_prefix> <extension_name[,name2,...,nameN] | *>
#
# For example the following will allow file URL's to only run the filereader
# and sqlite3 extensions:
#  file:///    filereader,sqlite3
#
# The following will allow local loopback URL's to run any extension:
#  http://127.0.0.1/  *
#
# The first matching URL prefix is used. Note that it is important for extra
# security to specify a slash after any domain name or IP address in the url
# prefix. This prevents a malicious web site from impersonating allowed URL's.
# For example if the http URL above had no slash after the IP, a URL of the
# following form would be allowed: http://127.0.0.1.malicious.com
# For this reason the QNX version of the JNEXT plugin will enforce that all
# URL prefixes contain at least 3 slashes.
