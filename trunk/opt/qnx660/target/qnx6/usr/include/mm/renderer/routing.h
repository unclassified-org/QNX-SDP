 *      are allowed to temporarily unlock it.
 *
 *    * The plugin can call the callbacks either from an interface call

 *      stop() call or the finished() or error() callback has returned.

 *      a successful create() call, but before destroy() returns.
 *
 *    * The eof() playback may be called when the plugin knows that it can complete
 *      the playback without more reading from the input.  Reading is assumed to be
 *      necessary after a prepare(), seek(), or speed() call -- the plugin can
 *      call eof() again from those calls when they don't create a need for reading.
 *
 *    * The plugin is free to use the lock and the wait() callback for
 *      its own private purposes.  They can be called at any time
 *      between the time create() is called and destroy() returns.
 *
 *    * The metadata callback consumes the mdata handle.
 *
