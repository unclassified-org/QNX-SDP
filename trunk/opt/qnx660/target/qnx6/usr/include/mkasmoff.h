/*
	This file, along with mkasmoff, is used to generate an assembler
	include file that contains the offsets of fields and values of
	manifest constants. The strings in the "COMMENT" macro will appear
	as comments in the resulting assembler include file. The first
	parameter of the "VALUE" macro will be the name of the assembler
	symbolic constant while the second parameter will be its value.

	Things are done in this roundabout way so that the correct
	values are generated even if the host system used to compile the
	kernel is not the same as the target system it's going to run
	on.
