/**
 * This header contains APIs for profiling library (libprofiling)
 * which allows you to start/stop the profiler dynamically.
 *
 * There are two functions you can call, and they must be called from within the same function.
 *
 *   QPROFILER_START() - to start profiling
 *   QPROFILER_STOP() - to stop profiling
 *
 * By default these functions would expand to empty expressions, to enable them define extra variable QPROFILING
 * as compiler/preprocessor define macro for the profiling build configuration.
 *
 * All other functionality of the profiler is controlled by environment variables:
 *
 QPROF_HELP=1              - print this help
 QPROF_AUTO_START=0        - do not start profiling automatically (wait for signal or API call)
 QPROF_FILE=<file>         - enable profiler trace capture and store output to the file/device
 QPROF_KERNEL_TRACE=1      - use kernel trace events instead of profiler trace, default is off
 QPROF_BACKTRACING=1       - use hooks for backtracing (instead of profiling), use API to collect backtraces
 QPROF_METHOD=<num>        - defines profiler method or timer, for constant value see constants below (qprofiler_method_t type)
 QPROF_SIG_STOP_PROFILING=<signum>   - install stop profiling signal handler, by default is not installed
 QPROF_SIG_CONT_PROFILING=<signum>   - install resume profiling signal handler, by default is not installed
