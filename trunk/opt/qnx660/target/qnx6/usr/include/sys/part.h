 * Common Partition devctl()'s (_DCMD_PARTITION)
 *
 * PART_GET_ID
 * 	retrieve the partition identifier for the partition identified by 'fd'.
 * 	The partition identifier is also returned in partition association and
 * 	disassociation events.
 *
 * 	On success, EOK will be returned by devctl() and the caller provided
 * 	'part_id_t' will contain the applicable information.
 * 	If any error occurs, the caller provided 'part_id_t' should be considered
 * 	to contain garbage.
 * 	The following errnos and their interpretation may be returned
 * 		ENOSYS - the partitioning module is not installed
 * 		EOVERFLOW - the caller has provided a buffer which is inconsistent with
 * 					the specified number of events being registered
 * 		EBADF - the PART_GET_ID devctl() has been issued on a name which
 * 				does not represent a valid partition name
 *
 *
 * PART_EVT_REG
 * 	register the caller to receive asynchronous notification of specified number
 *  of partition events
 *  On success, EOK will be returned by devctl() and the caller can assume that
 * 	all events have been successfully registered.
 * 	If any error occurs, none of the requested events will be registered.
 * 	The following errnos and their interpretation may be returned
 * 		ENOSYS - the partitioning module is not installed
 * 		EACESS - the caller does not have read permission on the partition name
 * 		EOVERFLOW - the caller has not provided a buffer large enough for the
 * 					specified number of events
 * 				  - the caller has provided a event parameter value which could
 * 					not be internally represented. This can occur if the processor
 * 					does support a 64 bit types
 * 		EBADF - the PART_EVT_REG devctl() has been issued on a name which
 * 				does not represent a valid partition name
 * 		EINVAL - at least 1 of the events to be registered contained invalid
 * 				 data
 * 		ENOMEM - the memory necessary to register the events could not be
 * 				allocated
 *
 * PART_GET_ASSOC_PLIST
 * 	return the list (part_plist_t) of processes associated with the partition
 * 	identifed by 'fd'.
 *  On success, EOK will be returned by devctl() and the caller provided
 * 	'part_plist_t' structure will contain some or all if the applicable
 * 	information (see @@ below)
 * 	If any error occurs, the caller provided part_plist_t structure should
 * 	be considered to contain garbage.
 * 	The following errnos and their interpretation may be returned
 * 		ENOSYS - the partitioning module is not installed
 * 		EOVERFLOW - the caller has provided a buffer which is inconsistent with
 * 					the amount of information being requested.
 * 		EBADF - the PART_GET_ASSOC_PLIST devctl() has been issued on a name
 * 				which does not represent a valid partition name
 *		EIO - internal I/O error. There is no information available or the
 * 				request to retrieve the information failed.
 * @@
 * When the caller provides the 'part_plist_t' buffer, the num_entries
 * field can be set to any value >= 0 as long as enough storage has been provided
 * to accomodate the value. If there are more entries to be returned than can fit
 * in the space specified by num_entries, then num_entries will be modified on
 * return to be the 2's compliment of the number of entries that would not fit.
 * Therefore, if you wish to first determine how many entries are required,
 * first pass in a part_plist_t buffer with num_entries set to zero. On
 * successful return, num_entries will be the 2's compliment (ie. negative) of
 * the num_entries that the caller should allocate space for (ie. num_entries = -10
 * indicates that the caller should allocate space for 10 entries).
 * If num_entries == 0 on successful return, all requested entries were returned.
 *
 * PART_SETFLAGS
 *
 * 	PART_SETFLAGS and PART_GETFLAGS operate on the /proc/<pid>/partition/
 * 	namespace and apply only to real partitions (only real partitions are visible
 * 	through this namespace). Suitable WRITE permissions must be present on the
 * 	partition path name in order to set the flags.
 *
 * 	set the process specific partition flags for the process <pid> associated
 * 	with the partition identified by 'fd'. Note that partition flags are process
 * 	specific and the process must necessarily be associated with the partition in
 * 	order to set the flags (it won't be visible in the /proc/<pid>/partition/
 * 	namespace otherwise). A process can have its process specific partition flags
 * 	set prior to association by utilizing a properly initialized 'posix_spawnattr_t'
 * 	object prior to the process being posix_spawn()'d (see posix_spawnattr_addpartid()
 *  and posix_spawn_addpartition() for more details).
 *
 * 	Process specific partition flags, if not set in the 'posix_spawnattr_t' object
 * 	prior to posix_spawn() will be inherited from the parent process for any
 * 	inherited partitions.
 *
 * 	For example, suppose a parent process A has partition X and Y associations
 * 	without any flags set. If it spawns or forks a new process, the child process
 * 	B will also be associated with partitions X and Y. Now suppose that process B
 * 	sets the part_flags_NO_INHERIT flags for partition X. Now if process B spawns
 * 	or forks a child process C (grandchild of A), child process C will only inherit
 * 	an association with partition Y. A subsequent spawn or fork by process A again
 * 	will have the child D be associated with both partitions X and Y (demonstrating
 * 	the per process behavior of the partition flags).
 *
 * PART_GETFLAGS
 * 	returns the per process partition flags for the process associated with the
 * 	partition identified by 'fd'. Suitable READ permissions must be present on the
 * 	partition path name in order to get the flags.
