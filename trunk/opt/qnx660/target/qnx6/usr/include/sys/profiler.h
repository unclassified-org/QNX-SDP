/*
 * Structure to pass info from client to profile agent
 * This is used by the devctl's to attach, add the main executable
 * code and add shared libraries.
 *
 * Normally, the executable puts the arc information in a shared memory
 * object that has the form /dev/shmem/prof-pid-%d, where %d is the key.
 * The profiler agent uses the info in shared memory to get call pairs,
 * total call numbers and so on. If the PROF_CAP_THREAD flag is passed, then
 * the library can do thread-level function call accounting.
 *
 * The name of the mapping is passed in for information purposes. This is
 * typically the basename of the executable for the main text segment, and
 * the soname of libs when passing in shared lib information.
 *
 * The PROF_COMMAND_QUERY_SHLIB and PROF_CMD_QUERY_THREAD can be used by the
 * library to determine if it should try to profile shared libs and keep
 * track of thread-level profile info.
