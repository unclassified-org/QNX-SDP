/*
  Dictionary object API

  A dictionary object is a collection of key+value pairs,
  where both the key and the value are strings.
  The API allows the creation of multiple "handles" to a dictionary object
  that can be independently used and destroyed
  by independent components of a program.
  (Note that multiple handles may be represented
  by identical pointer values; you should not compare handles.)
  Since a dictionary, once created, is immutable until destroyed,
  components can access it through their handles
  without worrying about synchronization.

/**
    Dictionary handle used to keep track of dictionary objects.

    As a convention, function parameters and return values
    declared as pointers to non-const strm_dict_t
    indicate that the ownership of the handle
    (i.e. the responsibility for destroying it)
    is transferred to or from the function,
    whereas pointers to const strm_string_t
    indicate that no transfer of ownership occurs.
    When a function returns a pointer to a const strm_dict_t,
    the guaranteed lifetime of the returned handle
    needs to be documented explicitly.
