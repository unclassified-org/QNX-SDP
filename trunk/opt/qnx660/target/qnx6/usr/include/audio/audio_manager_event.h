 * 
 * The audio manager controls audio routing, concurrency, and volume control
 * automatically. A client can subscribe to specific events to listen for
 * changes that are related to audio manager activities. The events are
 * broadcast to all clients and are asynchronous. The clients that respond to
 * the events are subject to act within a reasonable time frame in order to have
 * audio transition without artifacts.
