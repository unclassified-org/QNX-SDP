 * make any sense to define this variable. Code that wants to know what
 * the default PATH is currently (this is set in the mkifs control file)
 * Should execute the following code:
 *
 *	{
 *		size_t len = confstr(_CS_PATH, (char *) 0, 0);
 *		char *new;
 *
 *		if (len > 0) {
 *			new = malloc(len + 1);

 *			def_path = new;
