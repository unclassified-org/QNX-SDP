/*
 * The following structures define the format of the ".filetable" file.
 * It consists of 64 byte entries. Each entry starts with two unsigned shorts.
 *   efid - This entry has extended information at index efid
 *   pfid - This entry belongs under another entry at index pfid
 *
 * These are simple indices to other 64 byte entries in the ".filetable".
 *
 * There are two general types of entry.
 *   File entry      - Top bit of efid is 0
 *   Extension entry - Top bit of efid is 1 (mask it off to index)
 *
 * The File entry is by far the most common and is used to hold file and
 * directory entries for the filesystem. Note that pfid is used to implement
 * the directory hierarchy. For a file entry the efid is currently used to
 * point to an extension entry to hold long filenames. The pfid of
 * an extension entry must point back to the original file entry. An
 * extension entry has a type field (tacked at the end so as not to mess up
 * alignment) which should allow new extension types to be implemented in
 * the future.
