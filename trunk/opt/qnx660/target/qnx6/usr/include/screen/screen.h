*   Windows can parent only one group. Therefore, @c screen_create_window_group()

*   @c #SCREEN_EMBEDDED_WINDOW. Windows with a type of

*

*   is destroyed. When a parent window is destroyed, all children are orphaned
*   and made invisible. Destroying a child has no effect on the group other than
*   removing the window from the group.
*

*   used by the parent to set properties or send events. Conversely, the parent
*   gets notified when a child window gets destroyed. The parent window is
*   expected to destroy its local copy of the window handle when one of its
*   children is destroyed.
*
*   @param  win The handle of the window for which the group is created. This
*           window must have been created with @c screen_create_window_type() with

*

*   be posted are defined by the dirty rectangles contained in the
*   @c dirty_rects argument. Note that a window will not be made visible until
*   @c screen_post_window() has been called at least once.
*
*   In addition to the area(s) defined by @c dirty_rects, Screen may update
*   the other pixels in the buffer (i.e., Screen posts entire buffers, using
*   @c dirty_rects as a guide). Screen may also retrieve data from the buffer
*   at times other than when @c screen_post_window() is called (e.g., when the
*   contents or properties of overlapping windows are updated, or when the
*   window's entire buffer is continuously read by the display hardware until
*   another buffer is posted to replace it). Therefore, your application
*   must ensure that the entire contents of a window buffer is suitable for
*   display at all times until a new buffer is posted to the window
*   and the content of the display has been updated from the new buffer.
*
*   @c screen_post_window() returns immediately if render buffers are available
*   and if @c #SCREEN_WAIT_IDLE is not set. The use of multiple threads or
*   application buffer management schemes to render at the full
*   display frame rate are not necessary because unlike equivalent calls in
*   other graphics systems, @c screen_post_window() does not always block.
*
*   If @c #SCREEN_WAIT_IDLE is set in the flags, the function will return only
*   when the contents of the display have been updated.
*
*   This function may cause the @c #SCREEN_PROPERTY_RENDER_BUFFERS property of
*   the posting window to change. At any time, only one thread must operate on,
*   or render, into this window. If your application uses multiple threads, you
*   must ensure that access to this window's handle by these threads is guarded.
*   If not, @c #SCREEN_PROPERTY_RENDER_BUFFERS may reflect out-of-date information
*   that can lead to animation artifacts. The presentation of new content may
*   result in a copy or a buffer flip, depending on how the composited windowing
*   system chooses to perform the operation. Use the window property
*   @c #SCREEN_PROPERTY_RENDER_BUFFER_COUNT to determine the number of buffers
*   you have that are available for rendering.
*
*   If the window is currently locked, posting updates has the effect of flushing
*   all pending property changes and blocks until all other locked windows have
*   released the lock or posted updates of their own. In this case, the window
*   remains locked when @c screen_post_window() returns, and any subsequent
*   property change is delayed until the window lock is released or another
*   frame is posted.
*
*   If count is @c 0, the buffer is discarded and a new set of
*   rendering buffers is returned. The current front buffer remains unchanged
*   and the contents of the screen will not be updated.
*
*   @param  win The handle for the window whose content has changed.
*   @param  buf The rendering buffer of the window that contains the changes
*           needed to be made visible. Most applications use only two buffers

*           in the first element of @c the #SCREEN_PROPERTY_RENDER_BUFFERS
*           property of the window. Screen rotates the buffer handles accordingly
*           so that the first buffer handle of @c #SCREEN_PROPERTY_RENDER_BUFFERS
*           is one that is available.
*   @param  count The number of rectangles provided in the @c dirty_rects
*           argument.
*   @param  dirty_rects An array of integers containing the x1, y1, x2, and y2

*           buffer that has changed since the last posting of the window. The
*           @c dirty_rects argument must provide at least @c count * 4 integers.
*   @param  flags A bitmask that can be used to alter the default posting
*           behaviour. Valid flags are of type Screen_Flushing_Types.
*
*   @return @c 0 if the area of the rendering buffer that is marked dirty has

/**
*   @brief Cause a window to share buffers which have been created for or

*
*   <b>Function Type:</b>  <a href="manual/rscreen_flushing_execution.xml">Flushing Execution</a>
*
*   This function is used when a window needs to share the same buffers created
*   for, or attached to, another window. For this operation to be successful,
*   the window that is the owner of the buffer(s) to be shared must have at
*   least one buffer that was created with @c screen_create_window_buffers() or
*   attached with @c screen_attach_window_buffer(). Buffers cannot be created or
*   attached to any window that is sharing the buffers owned by another window.
*   Updates can only be posted using the window that is the owner of the buffers
*   (i.e. the window whose handle is identified as @c share). Any window that is
*   sharing buffers with another window is orphaned from the buffers and made
*   invisible when the window who owns the buffer(s) is destroyed. At this time,
*   that status of each orphaned window is such that a new buffer can be created
*   for it, or @c screen_share_window_buffers() can be called again. You can use the
*   @c screen_share_window_buffers() function to improve performance by reducing
*   the amount of blending on the screen. For example, a window might be
*   entirely transparent except for a watermark that needs to be blended in a
*   corner. Blending the entire window is costly and can be avoided by setting
*   the transparency of this window to @c #SCREEN_TRANSPARENCY_DISCARD. To keep the
*   watermark visible, another window can be created and made to share buffers
*   with the main window. This way, most of the window is discarded and a much
*   smaller area is actually blended. Any window property, such as
*   @c #SCREEN_PROPERTY_FORMAT, @c #SCREEN_PROPERTY_USAGE, and
*   @c #SCREEN_PROPERTY_BUFFER_SIZE, which was set prior to calling
*   @c screen_share_window_buffers(), is ignored and reset to the values of the
*   parent window.
*
*   @param  win The handle of the window that will be sharing the buffer(s) owned
*           by another window.
*   @param  share The handle of the window whose buffer(s) is to be shared.
*
*   @return @c 0 if the windows are sharing buffers,
*           or @c -1 if an error occurred
*           (@c errno is set; refer to <tt>/usr/include/errno.h</tt>
*           for more details). Note that the error may also have been caused by
*           any delayed execution function that's just been flushed.
