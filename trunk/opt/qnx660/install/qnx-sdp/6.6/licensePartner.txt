QNX(R) PARTNER SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

The software and related documentation that you are about to access (the "Software", as further defined below) is offered by QNX Software Systems Limited ("QSS"), an Ontario corporation having offices at 1001 Farrar Road, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K2K 0B3 (ph.: +1-613-591-0931, fax: +1-613-591-3579), to you (either as an individual or on behalf of the entity you represent, provided you are authorized to act on its behalf) for use in accordance with the terms and conditions below.

By answering "I ACCEPT" during the download, installation or activation of the Software, you represent that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this QNX Partner Software License Agreement, including (as applicable) Schedules A and B (any one or more, this "License"). If you do not accept these terms and conditions then you are not granted a license and are not authorized to download, install, activate, access or use any of the Software.


TERMS AND CONDITIONS


0.  BACKGROUND.

QSS has developed and licenses a general purpose real-time operating system known as the QNX (R) Neutrino (R) RTOS ("QNX Neutrino RTOS"). Its microkernel architecture provides an extensible operating system framework based on the foundational components of the kernel, system libraries and frameworks. Additional operating system services are implemented by plugging in other software modules (e.g., networking, file systems, etc.). These modules are licensed as part of the base "QNX Neutrino RTOS" runtime components. When modified or configured to operate on target hardware, the QNX Neutrino RTOS provides a microkernel operating system with advanced memory protection, distributed processing, symmetric multiprocessing, a dynamically upgradeable architecture, and real-time performance.

Other more specialized QNX middleware products (e.g., QNX SDK for Apps and Media, QNX CAR (TM) Platform for Infotainment and QNX Acoustics Products (as identified in the License Guide); any one or more, "QNX Middleware") are made available by QSS as separately licensed products. For the purpose of this License, any one or more of the QNX Neutrino RTOS runtime components, and any runtime components of the QNX Middleware products you have licensed, may be referred to as the "Runtime Components" (as further defined below).

QSS also offers a related set of software development tools known as the QNX (R) Momentics (R) Tool Suite. Developers use the QNX Momentics Tool Suite to modify and configure Runtime Components and to develop applications to run on the QNX Neutrino RTOS. The QNX Momentics Tool Suite includes compilers, debuggers, libraries, header files, utilities, sample source code, test suites, performance optimization tools, etc., within an integrated development environment based on the open Eclipse IDE framework. The QNX Middleware products may also come with supplementary development tool components.  For the purpose of this License any one or more of these QNX Middleware tool components and the QNX Momentics Tool Suite will be considered the "QNX Tools" to the extent you have licensed those products. Any one or more of the Runtime Components and the QNX Tools may be referred to as the "QNX Product Portfolio" (as further defined in the License Guide). 

More detailed QNX Product Portfolio information is available in the corresponding version-specific QNX License Guide published at http://licensing.qnx.com/document-archive/  ("License Guide", which is hereby incorporated into this License), a copy of which can also be found in the file system installation of the Software. The License Guide provides important version-specific information about the nature and scope of license rights granted (or not granted) to you hereunder. For that reason the License Guide should be carefully reviewed. Please contact licensing@qnx.com if you have any questions.

The QNX Momentics Tool Suite and QNX Neutrino RTOS components (collectively, the "QNX Software Development Platform" or "QNX SDP") are initially delivered together and are licensed on a named-user basis for development purposes under this License. QNX Middleware products are usually delivered separately and may have a different licensing model.  For example, QNX Acoustics Products are licensed for development purposes under this License on a Project (as defined in Section 1 (Definitions) below) basis (see Schedule B (QNX Middleware Addendum) and the License Guide for further details on QNX Middleware licensing). Development licenses for each component of the QNX Product Portfolio are available on either a perpetual (paid-up license) or time limited (subscription) basis, except as noted in Schedule B (QNX Middleware Addendum) (e.g., the QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment is licensed for development purposes under this License solely on a subscription basis and generally only for QNX-based automotive development projects). These and other important details about your license rights in the Software are specified in the "Development License Certificate(s)" that QSS sent you when you obtained your Software license(s). Development License Certificates are important documents because they define and authenticate your rights under this License. Please contact licensing@qnx.com if you have lost or misplaced your Development License Certificate(s). 

QNX Neutrino RTOS developers typically use their QNX Tools and a subset of the Runtime Components to build an embedded computing system or device ("Target System", as further defined below) by:

(a)  	developing the necessary code to make the QNX Neutrino RTOS operational on the Target System hardware (i.e., a board support package ("BSP") comprising initial program load ("IPL"), start-up and drivers, various parts of which may be available from QSS or its hardware partners in binary form for supported processors and peripherals or, alternatively, which may be developed from scratch or derived from QSS or partner-supplied sample source code and/or your own pre-existing code), and

(b)  	integrating Runtime Component object code programs, libraries and utilities with files the developers have generated using their QNX Tools in order to define the system's operational constraints, to tailor its functionality and, if equipped with a graphical user interface, to create its appearance, in order to meet the Target System's design requirements.

Ultimately QNX Neutrino RTOS developers will choose a subset of Runtime Components to include in their Target System. Over the Target System's life cycle, QNX Neutrino RTOS developers may elect to upgrade hardware platforms (requiring a repetition of step (a) above) and/or update software components (e.g., by adopting Runtime Component Updates (as defined below, also see Schedule A (Maintenance & Support Addendum)), or by introducing new Runtime Components) in order to enhance the Target System's reliability, performance and functionality. So, it is quite possible that a Target System's Runtime Components will change overtime. 

QSS licenses the QNX Product Portfolio for commercial development activities under its QNX Commercial Software License Agreement ("CSLA"). The CSLA allows licensees to commercially develop Runtime Component- or QNX Tools- based applications and Runtime Component-based derivative works, on their own or with technical support or custom engineering assistance from QSS (see http://licensing.qnx.com/services/). Commercial development licenses for QNX Middleware products are also offered under the CSLA. These commercial licenses allow developers to charge fees for their QNX Product Portfolio-based products or services, provided that they obtain a distribution license for any Runtime Components they want to offer. If you are interested in obtaining commercial development license rights please contact an authorized QSS sales representative for more information. QSS also makes the QNX Product Portfolio available to members of the QNX ecosystem under the terms and conditions of this QNX Partner Software License Agreement in order to provide easy access to QNX technology with the aim of increasing the pool of generally available technology for mutual customers and specifically to enable QNX Partners to obtain QNX Tools as necessary to develop generally available products and/or services that are complementary to QNX technology.  This is the "Spirit of this License". QSS is prepared to extend this QNX Partner Software License Agreement to you at a reduced cost, thereby providing many of the license rights normally only available to customers paying full price under the CSLA, provided and so long as your activities fall within the Spirit of this License and the authorized purposes, as specified below. 

Certain components of the QNX Product Portfolio are available from QSS under the terms and conditions of the Apache License, Version 2.0 ("Apache License"), the Eclipse Public License, or other open source licenses. The open source components and contributions in the Commercially Released Software, and the licenses to which they are subject, are identified in the version-specific License Guide and the corresponding Third Party License Terms List, which is also published at http://licensing.qnx.com/document-archive/ and found in the file system installations of the Software ("Third Party Terms List", which is hereby incorporated into this License).

10.  FEEDBACK.   QSS welcomes suggestions, comments or other feedback about its products and services (e.g., regarding their utility, reliability, or performance) and your user experience with the Software, as well as any bug-fixes, features, functionality or enhancements you would like to see in future versions ("Feedback"). You agree that all Feedback is and will be given entirely voluntarily and, even if designated as confidential, will not create any confidentiality obligations for QSS. You represent and warrant that you will not provide any Feedback that you know or have reason to believe might infringe any third party intellectual property rights or misappropriate any third party confidential information or trade secrets. Except as expressly stated above, any Feedback you provide will be considered to be provided "as is" without any warranty or condition of any kind, whether express or implied. If you require QSS to enter into an intellectual property license to use any Feedback then, either at the time of providing your Feedback or within ten (10) business days thereafter, you will notify the person to whom you are providing the Feedback and will provide notice to QSS's licensing group at licensing@qnx.com. In the absence of such notification you hereby grant to QSS a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, directly and indirectly sub-licensable, paid up and royalty free right and license to exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose including without limitation to make (or have made), develop (or have developed), modify (or have modified), reproduce (or have reproduced), use (or have used), import or export (or have imported or exported), offer for sale or sell (or have offered for sale or have sold), license (or authorize others to license) and distribute or otherwise dispose of (directly and indirectly) as part of any of QSS's or its Affiliates' business, technology, products or services, and to grant others the right to do any of the foregoing.


11.  U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS.   Notwithstanding any agreement with a third party or any provision of law, regulation or policy, if you are an agency of the government of the United States of America, then your rights in respect of the Software shall not exceed the rights provided under this License, unless expressly agreed upon by QSS in a written agreement between you and QSS and signed by a signing officer of QSS.

13.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

13.1	In this License:

"Confidential Information" means any information in any form or medium: 

(a) 	that is proprietary or confidential to the disclosing party ("Discloser"), its Affiliates, or to their respective customers, suppliers or other business partners, including without limitation information that is embedded in or related to Discloser's products or services, or to the development, testing or commercial exploitation thereof; 

(b) 	that is either specifically identified as confidential prior to or at the time of its disclosure, or would generally be considered confidential in the embedded software industry; and 

(c) 	that is directly or indirectly disclosed to the receiving party ("Recipient") by or on behalf of Discloser, or to which Recipient is otherwise provided access by Discloser or on Discloser's behalf. 

QSS Confidential Information includes without limitation: 

(i) 	Software Source Code; 

(ii) 	Experimental Software, in any form, that has been made available to you at a password restricted site, including but not limited to the myQNX.com download center and password protected parts of Foundry 27;

(iii) 	myQNX.com and Foundry27 user account information, access ID's and passwords; 

(iv) 	Development License Certificates and License Keys; and 

(v) 	any benchmarking information for Experimental Software generated by or for you.

"Trade Secret(s)" means Confidential Information that is proprietary technology information (including but not limited to Source Code, algorithms, formulae, methods and processes), the disclosure of which to unauthorized third parties could cause Discloser to suffer a significant loss of competitive and/or commercial advantage in its markets.

13.2	DISCLOSURE, USE AND REPRODUCTION.   Except as specifically provided herein, Recipient will hold all Confidential Information in confidence in accordance with the terms of this License. Recipient shall use and reproduce Confidential Information only to the extent reasonably required to fulfill the purpose of this License. Recipient may provide access to Confidential Information to, and authorize the use and reproduction of Confidential Information by, Recipient's employees, Recipient's Affiliates for use by their employees, and Recipient's Contractors or Recipient's Affiliates' Contractors for use by their employees, but in each case only as reasonably required to fulfill the purpose of this License, and provided that: 

(a) 	all such persons have a need to know the Confidential Information and have entered into confidentiality agreements with terms and conditions that afford no less protection to the Confidential Information than the terms and conditions of this License; and 

(b) 	all acts or omissions of such persons will be deemed to be Recipient's acts or omissions.

Recipient will always remain responsible to Discloser for the full performance of the terms and conditions of this Section 13 (Confidential Information) by all persons to whom Recipient directly or indirectly discloses Discloser's Confidential Information.

13.3	OTHER DISCLOSURES.   In addition to the disclosure rights in Section 13.2 (Disclosure, Use and Reproduction), Recipient may disclose Confidential Information if and only to the extent: 

(a) 	it is required to do so by law, provided Recipient gives Discloser sufficient notice to enable it to seek an order limiting or precluding such disclosure, or 

(b)	an authorized signatory of Discloser provides Discloser's explicit prior written authorization. 

13.4	STANDARD OF CARE.   Recipient shall use a reasonable degree of care to prevent the unauthorized use, reproduction or disclosure of Confidential Information, which care shall not be less than the degree of care that Recipient uses to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature. 

13.5	SECURITY FOR SOURCE CODE.   You must store any copies of Software Source Code on computers and/or networks that are secured by controls employed by you for materials reasonably considered to be Trade Secrets or otherwise highly confidential.

13.6	EXCLUSIONS.   Information that Recipient can establish: 

(a) 	is presently known or becomes known to Recipient or its authorized disclosees from an independent source without obligations of confidence, 

(b) 	is in or enters the public domain after the date of initial disclosure to Recipient through no fault or act of Recipient or its Affiliates, or their Contractors, 

(c) 	was independently developed by or on behalf of Recipient or its authorized disclosees, or 

(d) 	is Feedback provided pursuant to Section 10 (Feedback), 

shall not be considered Confidential Information under this License. 

13.7	CONFIDENTIALITY PERIOD.   Recipient's duties with respect to Confidential Information under this License will expire five (5) years after the end of this License (except for Trade Secrets, which shall remain subject to the terms of this License for so long as they constitute Trade Secrets). 

13.8	RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.   Upon termination of this License, and upon Discloser's written request, Recipient shall promptly return all Confidential Information received from Discloser (including without limitation all copies thereof and any summaries of orally disclosed information in Recipient's or its authorized disclosees' possession or control) or will certify through an authorized signatory of Recipient that all Confidential Information has been destroyed. Failure of the Discloser to make such request shall not entitle Recipient to make any further use of Confidential Information, or otherwise extend Recipient's rights after termination of this License, and Recipient specifically agrees to cease any further use of Discloser's Confidential Information. Any electronic copies made as part of Recipient's standard backup and archival practices shall be excluded from the obligations of this Section; however, this License shall continue to apply to such Confidential Information, including but not limited to any restored copies thereof. The provisions of this Section shall survive termination of this License for any reason. Recipient may retain one copy of Discloser's Confidential Information in the confidential, restricted access files of its legal department for use only to prove compliance with the terms of this License.

13.9 	REMEDIES.   Recipient acknowledges and agrees that: 

(a) 	the Confidential Information has been developed at significant cost and has important commercial value to Discloser, its Affiliates or to their respective customers, suppliers or other business partners; 

(b) 	knowledge of all or any part of the Confidential Information may constitute insider information under securities laws or yield a competitive advantage over others not having such knowledge; and 

(c) 	disclosure or inappropriate use of Confidential Information could cause Discloser irreparable harm and that therefore Discloser will have the right to seek, in addition to any of its other rights and remedies, injunctive relief for any violation of this License without posting bond, or by posting bond at the lowest amount required by law. 

13.10	RESIDUALS.   Nothing in this License will be interpreted as precluding any representative of either of the parties or its Affiliates from making use of his/her general knowledge and skills in connection with other projects being performed on behalf of his/her employer, even if such general knowledge and skills have been furthered by his/her having access to the Confidential Information exchanged under this License. The confidentiality obligations of this License will not apply to Residual Information, where "Residual Information" means general technical, non-public knowledge, experience, know-how or information in a non-tangible form that is retained in the unaided memories of representatives, to whom Confidential Information is disclosed under this License, where such individuals are not consciously aware that the information forms part of the Confidential Information. A representative’s memory will be considered to be unaided if they have not intentionally memorized Confidential Information for the purpose of retaining and subsequently using or disclosing it. The parties each acknowledge and agree that this Residual Information exception is intended only to alleviate the possibility of inadvertent breach of the obligations of this Section 13 (Confidential Information).   


14.  LIMITED WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITY.

14.1	BACKGROUND.   The Runtime Components comprise parts of a general purpose modular real-time operating system that is provided for use in a variety of vertical markets, on a range of hardware platforms and for a diverse set of Target Systems. You will select a subset of these modules for use in your unique hardware and software environment to implement certain desired functionality and performance characteristics. Ultimately, you may find that you cannot achieve your desired results. While QSS is committed to providing a versatile and reliable product, it does not warrant that the Software will function in accordance with its Documentation in every combination of hardware platform, software environment and software configuration. You acknowledge that errors are likely to be encountered when the Software is used in your particular application. You therefore accept responsibility for satisfying yourself that the Software is suitable for your intended use. This includes conducting rigorous testing of the Software in combination with your derivative works and value-added software application(s) on your target hardware platform. It also includes thorough hazard and risk analysis and risk mitigation at the system level to determine whether faults could impact the functional safety of your Partner Product or any Target System in which it may be used. The system design, system validation and the decision to release Partner Products are all matters solely within your control. These are decisions that can fundamentally impact the functional safety of the system being deployed, over its entire life cycle. QSS offers custom support plans and custom engineering services under separate agreements, to help developers identify and solve particular Software implementation and integration issues.

14.2 	EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE.  QSS makes Experimental Software available to you primarily at the Foundry27 web site, although other delivery mechanisms may be used from time to time. The myQNX.com download center is QSS's primary on-line source for Commercially Released Software updates, although some exceptions may apply. 

For example, projects on Foundry27 may post experimental, alpha and beta builds for components that may be included in upcoming commercial releases; whereas, Software updates that include the commercially released versions of such components are made available from the myQNX.com download center. Experimental Software from QSS, including but not limited to unsupported BSPs, drivers and sample Source Code, as well as trial tool and runtime components, are usually made available on Foundry27. If third party distribution restrictions prohibit Foundry27 postings, then QSS may have to offer certain Experimental Software as myQNX.com downloads. 

You acknowledge that you must always review any available Source Code, corresponding Documentation (including but not limited to new License Guides, Third Party Terms Lists and release notes) and download site notices to confirm the release status and any supplementary terms and conditions or other third party licensing considerations relating to Foundry27 and myQNX.com downloads (see Section 8 (Third Party Restrictions)).  

QSS offers access to experimental alpha and beta builds in order to give the QNX developer community the earliest possible access to the latest QNX Product Portfolio technology and bug-fixes. Other Experimental Software is offered as a means of accelerating your development by leveraging additional source or binary code. The form and nature of Experimental Software may change without prior notice to you and future versions of Experimental Software may be incompatible with developments on previous versions.

You acknowledge that QSS may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Experimental Software (or any features within the Experimental Software) to you at QSS’s sole discretion, without prior notice.  You should also be aware that significant changes, such as changes to or elimination of functionality or APIs, may be made to subsequent releases.

Many developers will migrate during their development cycle from QSS's Experimental Software to corresponding Commercially Released Software as it becomes available. Others may decide to ship Experimental Software after thoroughly testing the stability of such code and/or assessing the maturity of any milestone builds.

EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE MAY HAVE KNOWN DEFICIENCIES, MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FULLY OPTIMIZED AND TESTED, MAY NOT BE FULLY SUPPORTED BY QSS AND MAY BE UNRELIABLE. EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU STRICTLY ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND. IN NO EVENT WILL QSS AND/OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WHATSOEVER FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE ANY EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE.

14.3	LIMITED WARRANTY OF PERFORMANCE.   QSS warrants to you for a period of ninety (90) days from the Effective Date, that the Commercially Released Software licensed to you under this License, that is identified as Type I Software and qualifies for “Full” support in the applicable “Support Provided” column in the License Guide, will be free of Errors. An "Error" means when the Software, when used in accordance with the associated Documentation on one or more of the applicable "Reference Platforms" identified in the License Guide, fails to materially behave the way the Documentation says it should. Software will be presumed to be free of Errors unless the error or problem can be reproduced on a Reference Platform, and the error or problem does not result from modifications to, or incorrect or improper use of, the Software.

14.4	REMEDY FOR BREACH OF LIMITED WARRANTY OF PERFORMANCE.   Your sole remedy and QSS's sole obligation for any breach of the warranty of Section 14.3 (Limited Warranty of Performance) will be, at QSS's option, either to: 

(a) 	provide you with a free explanation, workaround or Update that allows the Software to be free of Errors; or 

(b) 	terminate this License pursuant to Section 17 (Term, Subscription Renewal & Termination) and, upon confirmation that you have complied with your obligations under this License, to provide you with a refund of any license fees that you paid to QSS or its authorized distributor pursuant to this License.

14.5	MEDIA WARRANTY AND REMEDY.   QSS warrants to you for a period of ninety (90) days from the Effective Date that any tangible media that QSS used to deliver the Software will be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use. QSS is not responsible for media defects that result from accident or abuse. Your sole remedy for any breach of this media warranty will be to receive replacement media.

14.6	INDEMNITY AND EXCLUSIONS.   Subject to the limitations of Section 15 (Limitation of Liability), if a claim is brought against you for Damages caused by the infringement of any third party copyrights or patents, or the misappropriation of trade secrets, arising out of your use or development of Commercially Released Software under the terms and conditions of this License (any one or more, "Infringement Claims") then QSS agrees to defend you against such Infringement Claims, and to indemnify and hold you harmless from resulting Damages and reasonable costs and expenses incurred (including but not limited to reasonable lawyers’ fees and disbursements), provided that you: 

(a) 	promptly notify QSS in writing of such Infringement Claims, 

(b) 	provide QSS with sole control of the defense and/or settlement thereof, 

(c) 	furnish to QSS on request all relevant information in your possession or control for such defense, 

(d) 	cooperate with and provide such assistance, at QSS's expense, in the defense of such Infringement Claims as reasonably requested by QSS, and 

(e) 	do not admit any such Infringement Claims and/or make any payments with respect to any such Infringement Claims without QSS's prior written consent. 

Expressly excluded from this indemnity are any assertions of: 

(i) 	copyright infringement or trade secret misappropriation based upon the use, reproduction, performance or distribution of any components of: (1) Experimental Software, (2) Software identified in the License Guide, or otherwise by QSS in the course of making the Software available to you, as Type III, or (3) Software that have been modified, supplemented or combined with other software, hardware or systems, where the Software on its own would not infringe; and 

(ii) 	patent infringement based upon the making, using, importing or selling of any components of: 

(1) 	Experimental Software, 

(2) 	Software that have been identified in the License Guide, or otherwise by QSS in the course of making the Software available to you, as Type II or Type III, 

(3) 	Software that have been identified in the License Guide, or otherwise by QSS in the course of making the Software available to you, as requiring additional patent rights not included in this License, 

(4) 	Software that have been modified, supplemented or combined with other software, hardware or systems, where the Software on its own would not infringe, or 

(5) 	Software that infringe any Essential Patent. 

In this Section "Essential Patent" means any patent or patent application which is necessarily infringed in order to use, make, sell, export, import or otherwise distribute a product, apparatus, software or other item that complies with a Standard, which patent or patent application would not have been infringed but for the compliance with such Standard, where, for the purpose of this Section, a patent or patent application is necessarily infringed because it is not commercially reasonable to implement a standard without infringing a claim of such patent or patent application because of the lack of a commercially reasonable non-infringing implementation.

14.7	REMEDIES FOR INDEMNIFIED CLAIMS.   If QSS reasonably believes that one or more of the indemnified acts in Section 14.6 (Indemnity and Exclusions) have occurred or may occur, QSS will, at its sole expense (subject to the limitations of Section 15 (Limitation of Liability)), and option: 

(a) 	procure for you the right to continue using the infringing Software; 

(b) 	replace the infringing Software with non-infringing software of comparable function; 

(c) 	modify the infringing Software to be non-infringing; or 

(d) 	if none of the foregoing alternatives is available to QSS on commercially reasonable terms, terminate your right to the Software, but only to the extent necessary to avoid or mitigate Damages. You will have the right to terminate all of your rights if you determine, in your commercially reasonable judgment, that such partial termination renders your remaining rights ineffective. Subject to the limitations of Section 15 (Limitation of Liability), upon such full or partial termination, QSS will refund to you, pro-rata to the extent of such termination, the fees paid by you pursuant to this License, if any, that are associated with the terminated rights.

SECTION 14.6 (INDEMNITY AND EXCLUSIONS) AND THIS SECTION 14.7 (REMEDIES FOR INDEMNIFIED CLAIMS) STATE YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR INFRINGEMENT AND/OR MISAPPROPRIATION BY THE SOFTWARE.

14.8	NO OTHER WARRANTIES. 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 14 (LIMITED WARRANTIES), AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE LICENSED AND ANY SERVICES OR HARDWARE PROVIDED UNDER THIS QNX PARTNER SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND TITLE. SUBJECT TO THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 14.3 (LIMITED WARRANTY OF PERFORMANCE), QSS DOES NOT WARRANT AND NOTHING IN THIS LICENSE IMPLIES ANY WARRANTY THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE  AND/OR HARDWARE, OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ANY ERRORS FOUND WILL BE CORRECTED.

14.9	SURVIVAL.   This Section 14 (Limited Warranties) will survive the termination of this License for any reason, and will apply notwithstanding the failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.


15.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL QSS AND/OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST REVENUE, LOST OR DAMAGED DATA, OR OTHER COMMERCIAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND/OR SERVICES, EVEN IF QSS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE OR CLAIM. 

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF QSS AND/OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED TEN THOUSAND (10,000) US DOLLARS. THIS SECTION 15 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) WILL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE FOR ANY REASON AND WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE CONSTITUTE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THIS LICENSE IN THE ABSENCE OF WHICH: (A) THE FEES AND OTHER TERMS IN THIS LICENSE WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT; AND (B) QSS'S ABILITY TO OFFER AND YOUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES OR ANY PORTION THEREOF UNDER THIS LICENSE WOULD BE IMPAIRED.


16.   THIRD PARTY LICENSES.   Certain Runtime Components may enable Partner Products and/or Target Systems to produce or reproduce (including but not limited to by ripping), copy, perform and/or display multimedia content (e.g., audio, images, video). The required intellectual property license rights necessary to use or offer devices with such capabilities will vary, depending on factors such as the intended use of the device, the types of content involved, the markets in which the device is used or sold, etc. You are solely responsible for determining all such requirements and making all of the arrangements (e.g., obtaining licenses, paying copyright collectives' fees, limiting the device functionality in some markets, etc.) necessary to make, use, import, distribute and/or sell your Partner Products for use in Target Systems, and/or to offer related services (to the extent permitted by the terms and conditions of this License), in all of your direct or indirect markets. The provisions of Section 14.6 (Indemnity and Exclusions) do not extend to infringement caused by producing, reproducing, copying, performing or displaying any multimedia content. Further, you agree to indemnify and hold QSS and/or its Representatives harmless from all Damages, and any reasonable costs and expenses incurred (including but not limited to reasonable lawyer's fees and disbursements) and Damages relating to any third-party action against QSS and/or its Representatives based on intellectual property infringement caused by making, using, importing, distributing and/or selling your Partner Products for use in Target Systems, and/or offering related services, in any of your direct or indirect markets ("Claims"), other than Claims based solely on infringement claims for which QSS remains responsible under Section 14.6 (Indemnity and Exclusions). 


17.  TERM, SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL & TERMINATION.

17.1 	TERM, SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL.   The term of this License for paid-up Software licenses will continue until terminated in accordance with this Section 17 (Term, Subscription Renewal & Termination). The term of this License for Software subscription licenses will end when the subscription term ends. You can renew Software subscriptions by issuing corresponding purchase orders to QSS at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiry date (see your Development License Certificate(s) for Software and Project License subscriptions).

17.2	TERMINATION.   This License will terminate immediately upon your failure to meet the partner eligibility requirements set forth in Section 4 (Partner License), or your breach of any one of the prohibitions in Section 6 (Prohibited Activities), whichever occurs first. This License will also terminate immediately for subscription-based licenses or services upon the expiration of your License Key or expiration of your subscription as defined in your Development License Certificate, or your failure to pay any optional renewal fees when due. QSS may terminate this License upon thirty (30) days' prior notice to you: 

(a) 	of a breach of a material term of this License if the breach has not been cured within the notice period, with the exception of payment or breach of confidentiality provisions, in which case termination will be immediate; 

(b) 	that you are violating the Spirit of this License, as determined by QSS in its sole discretion (during the thirty (30) day notice period you are encouraged to contact QSS to provide further information that may allow QSS to not terminate your license or to find another way to enable your activities); 

(c) 	if QSS decides to generally terminate the QNX Partner Software License of all or substantially all of its Partners; 

(d) 	if within six (6) months of acceptance of this License as a Partner you have not joined the QNX Partner Network; 

(e) 	if you do not, or no longer, qualify as a member of the QNX Partner Network; or 

(f) 	if within eighteen (18) months of your acceptance of this License as a Partner you do not offer and thereafter continue to offer a Partner Product. 

You may terminate this License at any time for any reason. Termination is without prejudice to any right or remedy that may have accrued or be accruing to either party prior to termination. 

17.3 	IMPLICATIONS OF TERMINATION.   Upon termination of this License, you will immediately destroy the original and all whole or partial copies of the Software, License Keys, and Development License Certificates used under this License that are in your possession or control. Termination will not relieve you from your obligation to pay QSS any and all fees or other amounts due under this License at any time or for any period. Any Software subscription fees, or pre-payment of license fees are non-refundable. If either party terminates this License for any reason all of your license rights, and those of your Affiliates and any Contractors, will immediately cease upon termination. The provisions of this License that are expressed or by their sense and context are intended to survive the termination of this License will survive, including but not limited to Sections 1 (Definitions), 5 (Deployment of Software and Audits of Software Use), 6 (Prohibited Activities), 7 (Preservation of Rights), 8 (Third Party Restrictions), 9 (Ownership and Reservation of Rights), 10 (Feedback), 11 (U.S. Government Rights), 13 (Confidential Information), 14 (Limited Warranties), 15 (Limitation of Liability), 16 (Third Party Licenses), 17 (Term, Subscription Renewal & Termination), 18 (Patent Non-assert), 19 (Governing Law), 20 (Assignment), 22 (Entire Agreement/Modifications), 23 (Interpretation), 24 (Notice), and B-4 (Audits of Software Use). Termination is without prejudice to any right or remedy that may have accrued, or be accruing to either Party prior to termination. 


18.   PATENT NON-ASSERT.   You agree that you will not, and will not assist, permit or enable any other party, to use Software Source Code or any other QSS Confidential Information, or any part thereof for the purpose of: 

(a) 	preparing, filing, amending, modifying or prosecuting any patent applications, 

(b) 	evidencing any alleged, suspected or claimed infringement of intellectual property rights, and/or 

(c) 	mapping or reviewing any product, service, technology, architecture or specification against patents, patent applications, claim charts or similar material. 

Further, you also agree that you will not, and will not assist, permit or enable any other party to: 

(i) 	assert or threaten to assert during the term of this License any patent, or

SCHEDULE B: QNX MIDDLEWARE ADDENDUM
___________________________________


B-0.  BACKGROUND.   This Schedule B: QNX Middleware Addendum ("Schedule B") together with the other terms and conditions of this QNX Partner Software License Agreement, provide the terms and conditions upon which QSS authorizes you to use Software that is QNX Middleware for development purposes within the Spirit of this License, provided that you first obtain a corresponding development license. Your QNX Middleware product entitlement is defined by the Development License Certificate you are issued by QSS.  This Schedule B is incorporated into the QNX Partner Software License Agreement. All defined terms in other parts of this License will have the same meanings in this Schedule B. The provisions of this Schedule B will prevail in the event of a conflict between any of its provisions and other parts of this License.


B-1.  QNX MIDDLEWARE SOFTWARE.   Your license under this Schedule B only extends to the specific QNX Middleware product(s) identified in the corresponding Development License Certificate you have been issued and only includes Updates thereto that QSS may, in its sole discretion, make available to you for use under this License (collectively, the "QNX Middleware Software", and part of the "Software" for the purpose of this License).  The QNX Middleware Software is further described in the corresponding License Guide. 

The QNX SDP, as well as the QNX SDK for Apps and Media and QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment QNX Middleware products, are related in that they have dependencies on each other. As illustrated in the License Guide, the QNX SDK for Apps and Media is dependent on the QNX Neutrino RTOS contained in the QNX SDP. The QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment is dependent on both the QNX SDP and QNX SDK for Apps and Media. As set forth in the License Guide, QSS licenses the QNX Acoustics Products for the QNX Neutrino RTOS and also for other operating systems, digital signal processors or other low cost processors that may not contain an operating system. If you are licensing one or more of the QNX Acoustics Product(s) for a QNX Neutrino RTOS based-system then this License applies to you.  If not, then you need to refer to the appropriate agreement (contact licensing@qnx.com).


B-2.  DEVELOPMENT LICENSE GRANT AND CONSIDERATION.   Subject to your payment when due of all applicable license fees (including but not limited to renewal fees for any subscription-based licenses) specified on the Invoice for the QNX Middleware Software development license you have purchased, and subject to the terms and conditions of this License, QSS hereby grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, personal, non-sublicensable, non-transferable and indivisible license for the QNX Middleware Software on the same terms and conditions specified in this License, except as modified by this Schedule B. Your QNX Middleware Software license is conditional on you having and maintaining valid QNX SDP licenses for all active developers involved in your development projects. Any license rights to Updates that QSS may make available to you as part of your QNX Middleware Software License are conditional upon your acceptance of any additional license terms and conditions (by way of further written amendment or new agreement), third party licensing prerequisites and the associated License Guide and the corresponding Third Party Terms List.   Any Update provided that is not Commercially Released Software will be considered Experimental Software for the purpose of this License, including but not limited to, Section 14.2 (Experimental Software) of the License.

Some of the QNX SDK for Apps and Media and QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment components contain third party technologies that require you to have your own direct license agreements in place before and for so long as QSS delivers and licenses such technologies to you ("supplementary QNX Middleware components", which include without limitation the Apple iPod Interface and QNX multimedia codec for Microsoft WMA9 - see the License Guide for more details). Some of these supplementary QNX Middleware component licensors require QSS to obtain positive proof that you have the requisite licenses in place. You represent and warrant to QSS that you and all of your authorized Contractors and Affiliates who will receive supplementary QNX Middleware component(s) are entitled pursuant to valid third party license agreements ("Prerequisite License(s)") to receive the supplementary QNX Middleware components. You acknowledge and agree that all license rights granted by QSS to you under this License to such QNX Middleware components will terminate upon termination or expiry of the corresponding Prerequisite License(s) and that you and/or your applicable Contractors and Affiliates will immediately advise QSS in writing of such termination or expiry. Upon QSS’s written request from time to time during the term of this Agreement, you agree to provide QSS with reasonable written assurances, from an authorized signing authority, confirming the existence and good standing of such third party licenses.  


B-3.  QNX CAR PLATFORM FOR INFOTAINMENT - SUBSCRIPTION LICENSE.   The license for QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment is a subscription-based development license granted pursuant to the terms and conditions of this License for the term of your subscription set forth in your Development License Certificate.  It is limited to use of QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment only in association with custom hardware platforms derived from the Reference Platforms for the QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment (as defined in the License Guide) and solely for your development purposes within the Spirit of this License in connection with your QNX-based automotive development projects (or other QNX-based vertical market-specific development projects authorized by QSS in writing).  As part of the subscription license to the QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment, you are also entitled to use the QNX Aviage Acoustics Processing Kit 2.0 QNX Middleware Software ("QNX AAP Kit") for development purposes. Notwithstanding the terms and conditions that apply to the QNX Acoustics Products, including without limitation Section B-4 (QNX Acoustics Products - Project License), the terms and conditions in this License applicable to the QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment apply to the QNX AAP Kit provided as part of your QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment subscription.

QSS may provide you with access to QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment reference images containing the Runtime Components of the QNX SDP, QNX SDK for Apps and Media and QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment (each, a “Reference Image") on hardware, loaded on an SD card or online at a secure site for download.  The Reference Image is solely to enhance your evaluation of the applicable Software. As detailed in the License Guide, the Reference Image also contains 3rd Party Reference Applications and other 3rd Party Licensed Code and may invoke web-based services.  The 3rd Party Licensed Code may only be used on Reference Platforms for QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment during the first ninety (90) days of your QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment license and only for evaluation purposes and not for any broader purposes that may be authorized pursuant to other terms in this License.  All rights in the 3rd Party Licensed Code granted to you by QSS will terminate ninety (90) days after the start of your QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment license. As detailed in the License Guide, 3rd Party Reference Applications and other Software identified as 3rd Party Licensed Code must be licensed by you for commercial development directly from QSS’s third party ecosystem partners. This includes, without limitation, Reference Platform-specific audio or video codecs, any web-based services invoked by the QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment, and any sample audio or video content provided.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any open source software contributions are subject to their respective open source licenses (and therefore are not time limited).

B-4.  QNX ACOUSTICS PRODUCTS - PROJECT LICENSE.   QNX Acoustics Products are licensed on a Project-specific basis. Multi-Project Development License Certificates may be available (contact an authorized QNX sales representative for more information see http://www.qnx.com/company/contact/).  Your QNX Acoustics Product QNX Middleware Software license is specific to a single Project and may not be transferred or reassigned to other projects. This QNX Middleware Software license ends when the Project for which it was purchased ends (or at the end of any subscription period in the case of a subscription-based license) unless earlier terminated under the terms of the License.

B-5.  NO STANDARD SUPPORT.   You may be required to purchase separate Custom support (as defined in the License Guide) for the QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment QNX Middleware Software from the start of your QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment subscription to at least the end of active development under your project(s) for which the QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment is being used. You may also be required to purchase separate Custom support for the QNX Acoustics Products.  Notwithstanding that the QNX Acoustics Products do not qualify for “Full” support in the applicable “Support Provided” column in the License Guide, the warranty pursuant to Section 14.3 (Limited Warranty of Performance) applies to the Commercially Released QNX Acoustics Products Software components that are identified as Type I Software in the License Guide.  Custom support for QNX Middleware is not covered under this License but is provided for in different agreements; contact an authorized QNX sales representative for more information (see http://www.qnx.com/company/contact/). This License supplements and does not supersede such agreements.


B-6.  DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE.   For the purposes of this Schedule B, Section 5.1 (Deployment of Software) of this License does not apply to the QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment or the QNX Acoustics Products and is replaced by the following:

You may deploy your licensed QNX Middleware Software to the following persons provided they have purchased and/or been assigned Development Seats (and License Keys or Floating License Keys) for the QNX SDP in accordance with this License, but only to the extent and for so long as they provide software development services on your behalf (i) related to QNX-based automotive development projects (or other QNX-based vertical market-specific development projects authorized by QSS in writing) for QNX CAR for Infotainment; or (ii) for the licensed Project for QNX Acoustics Products: 

(a) 	your employees, 

(b) 	your Affiliates for use by their employees, and 

(c) 	your Contractors, and/or your Affiliates' Contractors, for use by their employees, but only to the extent and for so long as they provide software development services on your behalf (or on your Affiliates' behalf). 

B-7.  AUDITS OF SOFTWARE USE.  QSS may request reports and conduct audits pursuant to the provisions of Sections 5.4 (Audits of Software Use) to Section 5.6 of this License in order to confirm compliance with the terms and conditions of this License. If you have licensed QNX Acoustics Products for more than one Project, you must identify all Projects in all reports and audits requested pursuant to this License.
